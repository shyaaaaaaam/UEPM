# UEPM
This is a web based project that takes advantage of PHP and Python to compute and predict pollution and weather in different regions of the world.<br />

I've use XAMPP to run the project through localhost, however feel free to use any other software.<br /><br />
Functionality:<br />
- Developed a real-time pollution monitoring system for providing up-to-date environmental data to users, enhancing public awareness and decision-making.
- Implemented RESTful APIs and Google Maps API for displaying pollution data on an interactive map, achieving accurate and timely visualization of pollution levels across different locations.
- Created a backend system using Node.js, ensuring seamless data retrieval and processing from multiple APIs, enhancing the reliability and speed of data updates.
- Applied K-Means clustering and Random Forest classification to analyze pollution patterns and classify regions based on pollution severity, providing actionable insights for environmental monitoring.
